The UK is suffering from a massive shortage of homes for people to live in. With the population growing and incomes rising but few new homes being built, it's no surprise that average house prices have risen more than 10% in the last year.

If you own your home then this might sound like good news. But if you're thinking about trading up then the house you want to buy just got even more expensive. And for millions of people, the dream of owning their first home is receding by the day.

A big part of the problem is the lack of new homes coming onto the market. So as well as making it easier to convert premises from business to residential use, we also need to free up more land for new homes.

A major constraint on the expansion of many of our towns and cities are our green belts. These were put in place from the 1930s to prevent urban sprawl, and cover 13% of England. Today many cities suffer a double whammy - people crammed into expensive homes in urban centres, and many more commuting huge distances on overcrowded transport links.

One of the big blockers is the notion that most people have, reinforced by the media, of the green belt as some sort of rural idyll. But the facts are stark: only 9% of green belt land in England is of outstanding natural beauty, and only 6% is of special scientific interest.

It's time to free up more land near our cities to accommodate the people who want to live and work in them. And building on brownfield sites alone won't be enough. Of course we should protect the best of our countryside. But fossilising the green belt is not the way to do it - and until things change, all of us are bearing the cost.
